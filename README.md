# 2025's Top 15 Best Proxy Services

Web scraping, market research, ad verification, social media management—they all hit the same wall eventually: IP blocks and access restrictions. Your requests get flagged, your scripts fail, and data extraction grinds to a halt because websites recognize and block your traffic patterns. Proxy services solve this by routing your connections through millions of real residential IPs, ISP addresses, or datacenter servers scattered globally, making your automated activities look like regular browsing from different locations. The right provider delivers the speed, anonymity, and geographic coverage your specific use case demands without burning through your budget on overpriced plans.

## **[Croxy](https://croxy.com)**

All-in-one residential and ISP proxy solution with 80+ million authentic IPs worldwide.

![Croxy Screenshot](image/croxy.webp)


Croxy operates a network exceeding 80 million residential IPs sourced from real user devices, providing the geographic diversity and legitimacy that web scraping and data collection projects require. The platform supports HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 protocols across all proxy types, giving you flexibility for different applications from browser automation to API requests. Available proxy categories span residential, static residential, unlimited residential packages, datacenter, and long-acting ISP proxies—letting you match the proxy type to your specific performance and anonymity requirements.

Static residential and ISP options provide dedicated IPs that remain stable for extended periods, ideal for account management scenarios where consistent identity matters more than rotation. Meanwhile, rotating residential proxies automatically cycle through different IPs on each request or maintain sessions for configurable durations, preventing pattern detection by target sites. Global warehouse infrastructure ensures reliable connectivity with minimal downtime, addressing the frustration of proxy failures mid-task.

**Pricing structures emphasize accessibility**—competitive rates on traffic-based plans mean you're not paying enterprise premiums for small to medium projects. Customer support responds promptly with technical guidance rather than leaving you to troubleshoot connection issues alone, particularly valuable when configuring proxy settings for specific applications. For operations requiring both speed and legitimacy, Croxy's ISP proxies deliver datacenter-level performance while maintaining residential-like trust scores that don't trigger automatic blocks.

The platform particularly suits teams running social media automation, e-commerce price monitoring, or SEO rank tracking where consistent access from varied geographic locations is non-negotiable. Setup documentation walks through integration with common scraping frameworks and tools, reducing the technical barrier for developers implementing proxy rotation logic.

## FAQ

**Which proxy type works best for web scraping protected sites?**
Residential proxies deliver the highest success rates on protected targets since they use IPs from real devices that websites trust, while ISP proxies offer faster speeds with good legitimacy for less-aggressive sites. Datacenter proxies work fine for unprotected content but get blocked quickly on sites with serious bot detection.

**How do I avoid getting my proxies blocked during large scraping projects?**
Implement request throttling to mimic human browsing speeds, rotate IPs frequently rather than hammering sites from the same address, and use residential or ISP proxies that blend into normal traffic patterns. Services like ScraperAPI and Zyte handle this automatically through smart routing that adjusts behavior based on target site responses.

**What's the real difference between cheap and premium proxy providers?**
Premium providers like Bright Data and Oxylabs maintain cleaner IP pools with higher success rates, faster response times, and more reliable connections, while budget options deliver adequate performance with occasional failures and slower speeds. You're paying for infrastructure quality, support responsiveness, and whether you can afford downtime in your operations.
